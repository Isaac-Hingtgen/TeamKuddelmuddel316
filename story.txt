There was a clown named Wolfgang who was performing at a party located at a Biergarten in Berlin.
The people attending the party were not very amused and decided to start throwing Apfelkuchen and other Gebaeck at him.
When people ran out of food to throw, they went to the Baeckerei and bought some more!
Amidst the chaos, Wolfgang quipped, "Ein Apfelkuchenregen? Lachnummer!" 
Everything changed when Wolfgang witnessed eine Bratwurst flying through the air.
Having skipped lunch, Wolfgang was very hungry and skillfully caught the Bratwurst between two slices of Brot.
However, before Wolfgang, the disappointing clown, could take a bite, a small Hund jumped out of his own pocket and devoured the Bratwurst within seconds.
Enraged, Wolfgang chased the small Hund on the Hauptstrasse until reaching an enormous Schloss!
