There was a clown named Wolfgang who was performing at a party located at a Biergarten in Berlin.
The people attending the party were not very amused and decided to start throwing Apfelkuchen and other Gebaeck at him.
When people ran out of food to throw, they went to the Baeckerei and bought some more!
Amidst the chaos, Wolfgang quipped, "Ein Apfelkuchenregen? Lachnummer!" 
Everything changed when Wolfgang witnessed eine Bratwurst flying through the air.
In a feat of unprecedented dexterity, Wolfgang, the disappointing clown, pulled a small Hund out of his pocket, which then snatched the Bratwurst out of the air.
